## Fork notice

Spotifoss is a fork of [Spotix](https://github.com/skyline69/spotix). Spotix itself was a fork of [psst](https://github.com/jpochyla/psst).

## Additional features over psst and Spotix
- Theme support with TOML themes (including custom colors and lyric highlighting)
- Spotify-style default dark theme with bundled Spotify Mix fonts
- Configurable cache size limit and cache usage display in preferences
- Playlist pagination toggle and real-time library search (playlists, albums, tracks, podcasts, albums)
- Saved playback state restoration (resume last track/position) and improved lyrics view (highlight, focus, auto-scroll)
- More fluid seek bar, bottom-bar cover click opens album, and platform release binaries
- More up-to-date dependencies and ongoing maintenance on the fork
- Automatic retry for transient network timeouts and throttling
- Built-in 10-band equalizer with presets and custom tuning
- Multi-select playlist mode with select all and bulk remove actions

## Status
- Early development; expect missing features and rough edges
- Requires a Spotify Premium account

## Build
- Rust stable (1.65.0 or newer)

### Linux dependencies
- Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libgtk-3-dev libcairo2-dev libasound2-dev`
- RHEL/Fedora: `sudo dnf install openssl-devel gtk3-devel cairo-devel alsa-lib-devel`

### OpenBSD (WIP)
```shell
doas pkg_add gtk+3 cairo llvm
export LIBCLANG_PATH=/usr/local/lib
```
If you hit rustc memory errors while building gtk:
```shell
ulimit -d $(( 2 * `ulimit -d` ))
```

### Install from source
```shell
cargo install --locked --path spotifoss-gui
# This installs the `spotifoss` binary to ~/.cargo/bin/.
# On Linux, the app auto-installs its .desktop file and icons on first run,
# so it will appear in your application launcher.
# --locked ensures the pinned dependency versions are used.
```

### Optional Spotify Developer Client ID
Spotifoss includes a default Spotify client ID, but heavy shared usage can trigger
Spotify rate limits. If you see repeated 429 errors, create your own Spotify app:

1. Open the [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard).
2. Create an app and enable Web API access.
3. Add `http://127.0.0.1:8888/login` as a redirect URI.
4. Copy the generated Client ID.
5. In Spotifoss, open Settings -> Account and paste it into Spotify Developer Client ID.
6. Re-authenticate with Spotify.

### Build from source
```shell
cargo build
# Add --release for release builds.
```

### Run from source
```shell
cargo run --bin spotifoss
# Add --release for release builds.
```

### Build app bundle (macOS)
```shell
cargo install cargo-bundle
cargo bundle --release
```

## Theming
- Place TOML theme files in `~/.config/Spotifoss/themes/`.
- Spotifoss ships with multiple preset themes that auto-install into that folder on first run.
- Each theme file must include a `name` field (e.g. `name = "catppuccin"`) and color keys. Example:
```toml
name = "catppuccin"
base = "dark"

[colors]
grey_000 = "#cdd6f4"
grey_100 = "#bac2de"
grey_200 = "#a6adc8"
grey_300 = "#585b70"
grey_400 = "#45475a"
grey_500 = "#313244"
grey_600 = "#181825"
grey_700 = "#1e1e2e"
blue_100 = "#a6e3a1"
blue_200 = "#89b4fa"
red = "#f38ba8"
link_hot = "#ffffff14"
link_active = "#ffffff0f"
link_cold = "#00000000"
lyric_highlight = "#cba6f7"
lyric_past = "#6c7086"
lyric_hover = "#cdd6f4"
playback_toggle_bg_active = "#a6e3a1"
playback_toggle_bg_inactive = "#313244"
playback_toggle_fg_active = "#1e1e2e"
icon_color = "#8e95b4"
icon_color_muted = "#6c7086"
media_control_icon = "#cdd6f4"
media_control_icon_muted = "#a6adc8"
media_control_border = "#585b70"
status_text_color = "#bac2de"
```
- Select themes in Settings → General. Custom themes are listed by their `name`.

## Project layout
- `/spotifoss-core` core library (session, decoding, playback)
- `/spotifoss-gui` GUI app (Druid) — binary name: `spotifoss`

## Privacy
Spotifoss connects only to official Spotify servers.
Credentials are not stored; a reusable token is used instead.
Cached data is stored locally and can be deleted at any time.

On first launch after renaming from Spotix, your existing settings are copied automatically from the old Spotix config folder.
